							<h1>On Faith and Science</h1>
							<!-- <h2>A few simple arguments suggesting that science and faith actually fit better than science and atheism </h2> -->
							<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p>It is often assumed that the burden of proof lies squarely on theists to prove how the existence of God is compatible with a scientific worldview.  But really, atheists have quite a bit of legwork to do as well, in order to show why naturalistic atheism fits with the modern scientific paradigm.  In fact, I argue that the modern scientific paradigm fits far more naturally with theism than atheism.  Here are a few reasons why*.</p>

							<p><div align="center"><b>The Predictability of the Universe, or <i>"Why does the Universe have laws at all?"</i> </b></div>Science rests on the philosophical assumptions that the Universe is orderly, intelligible, and predictable.  Of course, these assumptions are motivated by our own shared experiences of, for example, the constancy of the law of gravity.  (Reflect for a moment how incredible it is that the same mechanisms which terrified our ancestors by causing lightning to arc across the sky are so regular, dependable, and precise that today build microprocessors with them.)  A theistic worldview which invokes an intelligent Creator is completely compatible with an orderly Universe.  Conversely, an atheistic worldview has essentially no resources to explain why the Universe we look out and see really is so incredibly orderly, intelligible, and predictable.  </p>


							<p><div align="center"><b>The Fine Tuning of the Universe </b></div> Our modern physical paradigm, the Standard Model, has about 20 dimensionless numbers, numbers which do not appear to be arising from any deeper physical laws, and have to just be measured experimentally.  One example is the fine structure constant, which can be thought of as describing the strength of interactions between electrons and photons.  If these dimensionless quantities numbers were changed even very slightly, key processes for life to emerge and evolve would simply not take place.  For example, the nuclear fusion process that allows stars to generate their energy relies on the "triple alpha" process of fusing three helium nuclei together.  This process is highly disfavored compared to other comparable nuclear reactions, and only takes place because of a knife-edge energy resonance which would not exist if the fundamental parameters were changed even slightly.  In other words, if the parameters of the Universe were slightly different, stars could not shine.<br>

							To take another example, it turns out that there are no stable gravitational orbits in spaces with more than three spatial dimensions.  The stability and regularity needed for planets to form, and for life to emerge, requires exactly three spatial dimensions.  

							In short, the Universe seems fine-tuned for life on the level of its physical laws.  This staggering discovery has obvious theological implications, and meshes perfectly with a theistic worldview.  In order to escape the obvious conclusion that an intelligent force chose the Universe's parameters to allow life to arise, it is necessary to invoke a much larger "multiverse", which contains universes with different combinations of physical parameters— we just happen to find ourself in a Universe which is suited for life to exist (the so-called "anthropic principle").  The elephant in the room with this kind of reasoning is that there is, to date, <i>zero</i> experimental evidence for the existence of any universes beyond our own.  In other words, in order to escape the obvious conclusion that God created the Universe with life in mind, it is necessary to invoke a multiverse, a theory, which, amusingly, requires <i>blind faith</i>.</p>

							<p><div align="center"><b>Morality</b></div> A corollary of naturalistic atheism is that human beings are nothing more than complicated collections of atoms and biochemical reactions.  This strongly reductionistic view has shattering implications for our understanding of morality and moral duty.  If we don't care about disrupting certain collections of atoms (e.g. breaking a rock in two), why should we care about disrupting certain other collections of atoms (e.g. breaking a child in two)?  Naturalistic atheism has no resources to support traditional views of morality. <br>


							<i>My atheist friends tend to split into two broad camps at this point.  One camp says "Of course there are still morals, they arose from evolution!", and the other camp says "Of course morals are all made up–what's the problem?".</i>  

							Others don't see this as an issue.  But then why do many of these same atheists get up in the morning, work hard for others, and try to live good and selfless lives?  Why do they labor tirelessly for a life which they profess has no greater meaning or purpose whatsoever?  Sounds like cognitive dissonance.  Consider perhaps the greatest single proponent of moral nihilism, Friedrich Nietzsche, who spent his entire intellectual career claiming that moral claims are completely meaningless.  But on January 3rd, 1889, Nietzsche witnessed the brutal whipping of a horse that could not move under its crushing burden.  He ran to the horse and, sobbing, threw his arms over the animal to protect it.  Soon afterwards, he experienced a psychotic break, and spent the last ten years of his life in catatonia.
