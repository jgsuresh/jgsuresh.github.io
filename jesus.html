							<!-- <p>What's so special about Jesus?  How can Christians be so arrogant as to claim that Jesus is the only way to God?</p> -->
							
							<p>Here I want to give a few reasons why I believe Jesus is the single most remarkable person that has ever lived*. </p>

							<p>Imagine you are sitting in a room with no windows, and a single door.  In fact, you were born in this room, as were your parents, and your cousins, and your neighbors.  Everyone in human history was born in this room.  No one you know has ever peeked out of the door to see what's on the other side.  But every once in a while, someone gets up and walks out of the door, and never, ever comes back.

							Even though no one has ever seen what's on the other side of the door, it seems silly to assume that there's <i>nothing</i> out there.  Even if so-called experts and wise philosophers, who have lived inside the room their entire lives, give you long-winded arguments as to why you should not worry about the other side of the door at all, it would seem wi

							It is often assumed that the burden of proof is on people of faith to prove how belief in God could be compatible with a scientific worldview.  But in truth, atheists have plenty of work to show why naturalistic atheism fits with science.  In my opinion, it's much more difficult to coherently fit naturalistic atheism with science than it is to fit theism and science.  Here are a few reasons why:</p>

							<p><b>The Predictability of the Universe: </b>Science rests on the philosophical assumptions that the Universe is orderly, intelligible, and predictable.  Of course, these assumptions are motivated by our own shared experiences of, for example, the constancy of the law of gravity.  Justification for these assumptions arises naturally from a theistic worldview, which invokes an intelligent Creator.  However, an atheistic worldview has essentially no resources to explain why the Universe we look out and see really is so orderly, intelligible, and predictable.  </p>
							<p><b>Fine-tuning:</b> Our modern physical paradigm, the Standard Model, has 25 dimensionless parameters, such as the fine structure constant.  If these numbers were changed even slightly, the structure of the Universe would have been radically different than it is.  For example, the fact that the highly disfavored triple alpha process fusion reaction takes place in stars stands on a knife-edge which is easily destroyed by changing the fundamental parametersâ€” hence, in the vast majority of possible universes, stars simply don't shine, and life could not exist.  Or consider the fact that in universes with more than three spatial dimensions there are no stable gravitational orbits: the stability and regularity needed for life to emerge requires exactly three spatial dimensions.  
							In other words, the Universe seems fine-tuned for life.  Of course, some try valiantly to escape the obvious theological implications of this discovery by invoking a much larger multiverse which contains universes with different combinations of physical parameters.  Of course, there is to date zero experimental evidence for the existence of any universes beyond our own.</p>
							<p><b>Morality:</b> A corollary of naturalistic atheism is that human beings are nothing more than complicated collections of atoms and biochemical reactions.  This strongly reductionistic view has shattering implications for morality.  If we don't care about disrupting certain collections of atoms (e.g. breaking a rock in two), why should we care about disrupting certain other collections of atoms (e.g. breaking a child in two)?  Naturalistic atheism has no resources to support traditional views of morality.


							<i>Some see this as an issue.</i>  

							Others don't see this as an issue.  But then why do many of these same atheists get up in the morning, work hard for others, and try to live good and selfless lives?  Why do they labor tirelessly for a life which they profess has no greater meaning or purpose whatsoever?  Sounds like cognitive dissonance.  Consider perhaps the greatest single proponent of moral nihilism, Friedrich Nietzsche, who spent his entire intellectual career claiming that moral claims are completely meaningless.  But on January 3rd, 1889, Nietzsche witnessed the brutal whipping of a horse that could not move under its crushing burden.  He ran to the horse and, sobbing, threw his arms over the animal to protect it.  Soon afterwards, he experienced a psychotic break, and spent the last ten years of his life in catatonia.
